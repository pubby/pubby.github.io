            The goal is to progress through the floors by walking onto exits. Killing enemies is optional, but often a necessity as you can't take the stairs when an enemy is adjacent to you. Along the way, you'll collect gems which can be used to purchase items in shops.

        <ul>
            <li>D-Pad moves. Bump into enemies to attack.</li>
            <li>Start button is your inventory and ability screen.</li>
            <li>Hit select to examine things. This is kinda like an in-game help, and can be used almost anywhere including menus.</li>
            <li>A button casts spells, assuming you have one.</li>
            <li>B button is multi-purpose. Press and release it to wait a turn. Hold B down and press select to change weapons, press A to change spells, and press the D-Pad to change your facing direction.</li>
        </ul>
