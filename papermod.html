        <h1>Piece of paper quiets Intel Alder Lake stock coolers</h1>
    </head>

        <p>
        In 2022, Intel redesigned their stock CPU coolers to make them beefier, more performant, but primarily better looking. Still, it was a necessary upgrade, as their previous line was not adequate at cooling 12th gen CPUs.

        Looking at the images, I noticed a difference between their i5 cooler (on the left) and their i9 cooler (right): the i9 cooler had a blue plastic cowl around the fan, while the i5 had some weird open-air plastic fin design.
        </p>
        <h2>What happens if I add a cowl to the i5 cooler?</h2>
        <p>
        I created a cowl out of a piece of paper, taping the ends together to form a cylinder. It took finesse, but I managed to get the paper fitting snugly inside the cooler without the fan hitting it. No glue needed!

        In fact, I did more than just that. I actually tested a few cowls of different heights, from under an inch, to over three inches in height. Below are the results of testing using <a href="https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/blender-1.9.1">Blender as my benchmark</a>.

        <table>
            <tr><th>Cowl Height</th><th>Max CPU temp</th><th>Relative Noise</th></tr>
            <tr>
                <td>No cowl</td>
                <td>80 C</td>
                <td>+8 Db</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I was amazed at how quiet short cowls made the cooler. To give you an idea of how each sound, here is the stock noise, sounding like a dental drill:</p>

        <br>
        <p>And here is the 1 inch cowl noise, sounding like a windy day:</p>
        <audio controls src="papermod/1.ogg">Your browser does not support audio.</audio>
        <p>The difference could be heard at both full-load and idle.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the shortest cowl came with noticeably worse performance; presumably it was recirculating too much hot air. Still, there is a happy medium: <b>1.7 inch cowls cool as well as Intel's design, while being quieter</b>, though your results may vary depending on your case.</p>
        <h2></h2>

        <h2>Is this recommended?</h2>
        <p>If you want a great cooler, just buy one. Intel's offerings will never stack up to aftermarket models (even the cheap $20 ones). But if you're like me and are building a budget PC, you may hear an improvement using this paper mod. The process is quick, free, and low-risk, albeit higher risk than not doing so (and I'm sure Intel wouldn't approve). For that reason, I'll leave it up to you to decide.
