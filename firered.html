        <h2>A rom hack for impatient gamers.</h2>
        <p>
            Two things I dislike about classic Pokemon:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Grinding</li>
            <li>Beating the game using only one Pokemon</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This hack attempts to fix these problems by taking /u/Think0028's Exp. All patch and applying experience point scaling so that the game's difficulty remains balanced. The result is (hopefully) a game you can play from start to finish without having to farm for experience in tall grass.
        </p>
        <p>
In addition, this hack also include the 151 Pokemon patch from /vp/, which enables version exclusive Pokemon from Leaf Green to be found in the wild.
