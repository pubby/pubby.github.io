        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            Take That Towers is a tactical card game centered around dual-use cards with delayed effects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Players build skyscrapers together. Each turn they'll play cards from their hand face-up to construct floors and face-down to stake their claim on the resulting real estate. Once a tower is completed, the effects of each floor will occur and players score points based on the arrangement. Score the most points before the deck runs out to win.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game plays using a single 65 deck of square cards, and plays in a consistent amount of time regardless of the player count.
        </p>
