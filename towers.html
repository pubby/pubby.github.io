            <b>Take That Towers</b> is a tactical city-building card game that fits in your pocket. Construct high-rises with your friends, scoring points from the floors you build and the real estate you claim. Nothing's final until a tower is completed, so there's always a play to be made.</p>


            <p>
            Don't let the name fool you, <b>Take That Towers</b> isn't your mom's take-that game. You won't find obvious decisions tacked onto a derivative clone game here, though you will feel a rush when you foil your opponent's plays. The game is jam-packed with tactical strategies and interesting ideas. You'll love bringing it to the table.</p>

            <h2 id="faq">F.A.Q.</h2>
            <div class="whitebox">
                <h3>How is the game packaged / manufactured?</h3>
                <p>
                The game comes in a printed cardboard tuckbox with a paper rulebook and cards printed on 280 GSM blue core cardstock. It was printed in China. The product is approximately <span class="eq">2.5" x 2.5" x 1"</span> in size.
                </p>
                <h3>Can I build more than two floors per turn?</h3>
                <p>
                Nope. You must build exactly two floors per turn. However, you may claim ownership by tucking cards as many times as you like.
                </p>
                <h3>If the last player in turn order draws the last card from the deck, when does the game end?</h3>
                <p>
                The game would end immediately at that point. Score the remaining towers as-is without playing more turns.
                </p>
                <h3>How does the ELEVATOR card work?</h3>
                <p>
                To score an ELEVATOR, look at every card tucked face-down in its tower and count how many each player has played. Normally these face-down cards track ownership, but here you are only interested in who tucked what. In other words, the LANDLORD card won't modify the outcome of ELEVATOR. For each card tucked, award 2 points to that player.
                </p>
                <h3>How does the OFFICE card work?</h3>
                <p>To score an OFFICE floor, first count the total number of OFFICE floors in its tower (vacant or occupied, including itself), then multiply that number by two. The owner will receive that many points for that OFFICE floor.</p>
                <p>For example, if there are four OFFICEs in the tower, each OFFICE would award <span class="eq">2*4 = 8</span> points.</p>
                <h3>How do vacant floors work?</h3>
                <p>
                    Vacant floors resolve with no effect during scoring, meaning they'll never score points, draw cards, or change ownerships. However, they still have a name and they still have tucked cards, meaning OFFICE and ELEVATOR will count them. And while a vacant SPIRE will not score points, it does cause the tower its played upon to be scored.
                </p>
                <h3>Can I play any card as the start of a new tower?</h3>
                <p>Yes, even floors like INFERNO, LANDLORD, and SPIRE can start new towers.</p>
                <h3>I'm confused about the built-in score tracking. How does it work?</h3>
                <p>
                If you haven't already, watch the video on the top of this page to see how it's done. If you're still confused, it's probably better to use a pen-and-paper or some other method to track score instead.
                </p>
                <h3>Can I ask you a question?</h3>
                <p>
                Sure. My e-mail is at the bottom of this page. Include your question in your first message.
