        <h2>Tools</h2>

        <h3>Text Editors</h3>

        <p>You can use any text editor with NESFab, but 
        <a href="https://github.com/pubby/nesfab/tree/master/syntax_highlighting">only a few have syntax highlighting</a>.
        The following are guaranteed to work:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>
            is a modern text editor designed for developers.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>
            is an old, opinionated editor with many fans.
            It has a steep learning curve, but is very rewarding to learn.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you don't care about syntax highlighting, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is a great text editor for beginners.</p>

        <h3>Graphics - Tilesets</h3>

        <p>The NES is a tile-based system, and uses tilesets called <a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/PPU_pattern_tables">CHR</a>. 
        These tilesets are 2-bits-per-pixel, and are comprised of 8x8 pixel tiles.
        The following programs can be used to create and edit these tilesets:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/119/">YY-CHR</a>
            is a simple tool for editing CHR files. 
            The nice thing about it is that it's designed around NES limitations, and works with .CHR files directly.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>
            is a powerful image editor, similar to Photoshop. 
            Although it's not designed for pixel art, it suffices, especially when you enable indexed color mode.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://mtpaint.sourceforge.net/">mtPaint</a>
            is a simple image editor that's good at pixel art. It supports indexed colors, which is handy for designing CHR.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>NESFab can input either .CHR files, or .PNG files, so feel free to use whatever you like.</p>

        <h3>Graphics - Backgrounds and More</h3>

        <p>To produce graphics, tiles are arranged to encompass a background, 
        comprised of 256x240 pixel regions known as <a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/PPU_nametables">nametables</a>.
        Typically, these nametables are produced on-the-fly during gameplay, but in situations like title screens, it's handy to edit them by hand.
        The following programs can be used:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/802/">NES Screen Tool</a>
            is a very simple tool for editing nametables. 
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://frankengraphics.itch.io/nexxt">NEXXT</a>
            is an extension of NES Screen Tool, adding a myriad of features.
            It also supports editing sprites and CHR.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://nesrocks.itch.io/naw">NES Assets Workshop</a>
            is a powerful editor designed around NES limitations.
            It also supports editing sprites and CHR.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Depending on your game, you may rely heavily on these, or you may not.</p>

        <h3>Level Editors</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://pubby.games/mapfab.html">MapFab</a>
            is NESFab's official level editor.
            It is flexible enough for most games, while being simple to use. 
            NESFab can import its files directly.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a>
            is a powerful, general-purpose level editor.
            To use this, you'll have to write your own conversion scripts and work around its limitations.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Audio</h3>

        <p>NESFab includes its own audio driver called PUF, which has support for importing audio from the following programs:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Dn-Programming-Core-Management/Dn-FamiTracker">FamiTracker</a>
            is a tracker-based music editor designed around NES limits.</li>
            <li><a href="https://famistudio.org/">FamiStudio</a> is a piano-roll based music editor. When using it with NESFab, be sure to enable FamiTracker mode.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note that the PUF driver cannot handle every sound produced by these programs. 
        Before composing music, it's a good idea to read the documentation in the driver source code.</p>

        <h3>Emulators</h3>

        <p>You'll want an emulator to test your game. The following are recommended:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.mesen.ca/">Mesen2</a>
            is an emulator with a crazy amount of features and excellent debugging support.
            Every NES developer should have Mesen installed.</li>
            <li><a href="https://fceux.com/web/home.html">FCEUX</a>
            is a decent emulator with OK debugging support.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/nintendulator/">Nintendulator</a>
            is a very accurate emulator with OK debugging support. In particular, it's good for PPU debugging..</li>
        </ul>
