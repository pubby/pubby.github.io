                NESFab is a new programming language for creating 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">NES</a> games. 
                Designed with 8-bit limitations in mind, the language is more ergonomic to use than C, while also producing faster assembly code.
                It's easy to get started with, and has a useful set of libraries for making your first &mdash; or hundredth &mdash; NES game.

            <p>NESFab generates better 6502 machine code than any high-level compiler tested, including GCC and LLVM.
            It's possible that NESFab is the best performing 6502 compiler in existence.</p>

            <p>
                Traditionally, NES games were written by hand in assembly language, 
                as anything else at the time was too sluggish to run on the 1980's era CPU.
                NESFab isn't sluggish though!

        <h2>Automatic Bank Switching</h2>
        <div class="box wide">
            <p>
                The NES uses a 16-bit address space, 
                but most games need more data than 16-bits can represent.
                To overcome this limitation, 
                programs can be broken up into segments called "banks",
                and hardware on the cartridge can switch between these banks
                at runtime.
            </p>
            <p>
                Handling banks is normally a tedious affair for programmers, 
                but NESFab handles it for you. 
                The compiler smartly allocates code and data into banks,
                with the gritty details abstracted away.
            </p>

        <h2>Easy Asset Loading</h2>
        <div class="box wide">
            <p>
                Writing a half-dozen conversion scripts isn't fun. Luckily, NESFab automates asset loading and conversion for you.
                Just plop your assets into your project directory, import a library, and you're rolling!

        <div class="box wide">
            <p>The best way to get NESFab is by compiling it from the source, which will always be up-to-date. 
            For those who don't like compiling, binary releases will be provided from time to time.</p>
