        <h2>Water first, then pill</h2>
        <p>
            The typical pill-taker puts the pill in their mouth first, then chugs a bunch of water in an attempt to swallow it.
            This is wrong.
            By sipping, a turbulent flow of water hits the pill, jostling it around and making it difficult to swallow.
        </p>
        <p>A better approach is to sip the water first, holding a small amount of water in the mouth. Then, the pill can be inserted and swallowed without any turbulence.</p>

        <h2>Density matters</h2>
        <p>
            Not all pills are the same. Some &mdash; like vitamins &mdash; are dense and sink in water, while others &mdash; such as capsules &mdash; are filled with air and light enough to float. 
        </p>
        <p>To swallow dense pills, the optimal position is with the head tilted back. The pill will naturally sink towards the esophagus, and making swallowing easy.</p>

        <p>Likewise, to swallow light pills, tilt the head down. The pill will rise, again towards the esophagus.</p>
